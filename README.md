GetControl is a simple tool to collect and agregate the information from various files created during the structural
refinement of powder data using [FullProf](https://www.ill.eu/sites/fullprof/) software. It can get easy access to the supplementary files with further analysis.

I developed it to help me get a quicker overview and control over a vast number of additional info that you can obtain
from the refinement. The way it works is not suitable for all but someone can found it useful.

The tool is under continuous development. All bug report or suggestions are welcomed.

Information about the updates can be found [here](https://github.com/WildRams/GetControl-code/blob/main/gcupdateinfo.txt?raw=true).
